/* For this project, I created a fictional gamestore table containing all the games I'm selling on ebay with their prices, amounts sold. etc.
I started this project back in April 2022 and if you'll look further down, I later improved upon it by adding more information about the games, and changing
the table name as it was way too long of a title. */
