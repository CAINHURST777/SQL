/*The following is a fun little project I did to practice SQL in which you must use SQL queries to find clues in the tables of the database
to find the culprit of the murder. Here is the website where this can be found :https://mystery.knightlab.com/
A database schema of all the table can be found under the "The rest is up to you!" section towards the middle of the page. I included my thought
process as I worked through this project */


--SQL MURDER MYSTERY 

-- You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. 
-- using the first clue, I query the crime_scene_report table for more clues : 

SELECT
description, 
date
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE city = 'SQL City'
AND date = 20180115;

--This yields the following :  Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".	20180115

-- Given these clues, I use the following query to narrows down the names of the witnesses: 

SELECT name, 
address_number,
address_street_name
FROM person 
WHERE address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
AND name LIKE '%Annabel%'
OR address_street_name LIKE '%Northwestern Dr%'
ORDER BY address_number DESC; 

-- This query shows me a list on names. Only person named Annabel on Franklin Ave, Annabel Miller, id 16371
. Ordering by Street name, we get our second person,
the last address ( last house) on Nortwestern Drive, Morty Schapiro, id 14887. 

-- I then look for the names I found in the interview transcripts to search for any clues:

SELECT p.name, 
p.id, 
i.transcript 
FROM person AS p
LEFT JOIN interview AS i
ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE p.name = 'Annabel Miller'
OR p.name = 'Morty Schapiro'

-- I find the following :

/* name	id	transcript
Morty Schapiro	14887	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
Annabel Miller	16371	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th. */

-- next, we look at the database for the gym, Get Fit Now to see if we have any matches for this description. 
-- using the following query, we come accross two names that fit the description:

SELECT mem.person_id,
ci.check_in_date, 
mem.name,
mem.membership_status
FROM get_fit_now_check_in AS ci
JOIN get_fit_now_member AS mem
ON ci.membership_id = mem.id
WHERE ci.check_in_date = 20180109
AND mem.id LIKE '%48Z%';


/*person_id	check_in_date	name	membership_status
28819	20180109	Joe Germuska	gold
67318	20180109	Jeremy Bowers	gold */

-- from here, we must reference the person and driver_license tables, with the driver license table containing license plate info to see which of these 
two names has license plate number that includes "H42W".

-- I used the following query to narrow it down to one final suspect: Jeremy Bowers	

SELECT
p.name,
dl.plate_number
FROM person AS p
 JOIN drivers_license AS dl
 ON p.license_id = dl.id
WHERE p.name = 'Jeremy Bowers'
OR p.name = 'Joe Germuska'
AND plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';

--inserting that name into the solution table yeilds the following : 

/* Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to
 find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. 
Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.*/

-- I next look for the killer's transcript to look for clues about the mastermind of this crime using the following query: 

SELECT
p.name,
i.transcript
FROM person AS p
JOIN interview AS i
ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE p.name = 'Jeremy Bowers';

-- this query yields the following testimony:

/* name	transcript
Jeremy Bowers	I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
			She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.*/

-- Given the preceeding testinmony, I then ran the following query to narrow down the mastermind : 

SELECT 
p.name
FROM person AS p
	JOIN facebook_event_checkin AS fb
	 ON p.id = person_id
	JOIN drivers_license AS dl
	 ON p.license_id = dl.id
	JOIN income AS inc
	 ON p.ssn = inc.ssn
WHERE fb.event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
AND dl.height BETWEEN 65 AND 67
AND dl.gender = 'female'
AND dl.hair_color = 'red'
AND dl.car_make = 'Tesla'
AND dl.car_model = 'Model S'
GROUP BY p.name
HAVING COUNT(fb.date) = 3;

--this yields one name that fits all of the descriptions : Miranda Priestly

-- inserting that name into the solution query yields the following : 

-- Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time. Time to break out the champagne!

-- Miranda Priestly was the mastermind behind the murder comitted by Jeremy Bowers! I was also able to meet the challenge of figuring out the mastermind using 
only two queries!  Hurray!
