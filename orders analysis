Here is a some code I used in project analysing sales data. 


SELECT orderID,
       Product,
       Quantity,
       price,
       orderdate,
       location
  FROM JanSales;
  
-- HOW MANY SALES IN JANUARY

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

-- HOW MANY OF THE JANUARY ORDERS WERE FOR IPHONE?

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE Product = 'iPhone';
 
-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT cust.acctnum
  FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
       JOIN
       BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID;
       
-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT 
DISTINCT Product, 
MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price
limit 1;

-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT Product, SUM (Quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;  

-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

Select 
Product, 
SUM(Quantity),
sum(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product ; 

-- List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT 
Product, 
SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

--Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT
location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
GROUP BY location 
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3; 

-- How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT 
DISTINCT Product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;

-- What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT SUM(feb.quantity * feb.price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS avg_acct_spend
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust 
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id;

SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum) AS avg_acct_spend
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id;

--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT SUM(Quantity)/count(cust.acctnum) AS avg_quant
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id;

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product, Sum(quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY revenue DESC;


-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum),AVG(quantity * price) AS avg_spend
 FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
 LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as cust
 ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
 WHERE feb.Quantity > 2;
