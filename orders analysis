Here is a some code I used in project analysing sales data. 


SELECT orderID,
       Product,
       Quantity,
       price,
       orderdate,
       location
  FROM JanSales;
  
-- HOW MANY SALES IN JANUARY

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;
-- HOW MANY OF THE JANUARY ORDERS WERE FOR IPHONE?

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE Product = 'iPhone';
 
-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT cust.acctnum
  FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
       JOIN
       BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID;
       
-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT 
DISTINCT Product, 
MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price
limit 1;

-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT Product, SUM (Quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;  

-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

Select 
Product, 
SUM(Quantity),
sum(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product ;


-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum),AVG(quantity * price) AS avg_spend
 FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
 LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as cust
 ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
 WHERE feb.Quantity > 2;
