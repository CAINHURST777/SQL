/*This is my exploratory analysis of mental health surveydata found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anth7310/mental-health-in-the-tech-industry*/

/*As I explored the data, I realized that not all of the surveys were the same. 2014 and 2016 were much different than 
2017-2019. As such, 1:1 analysis would be difficult. As such, I decided to focus only on 2017- 2019 data for this analysis. As a result, 
I had to start over but due to the exporatory analysis,this occured around the question 10 analysis. I was able to establish a workflow to facilitate the rest of the analysis and narrow
my focus only to those questions I wanted to explore by creating views with to make queries easier. In addition, I used exported some query results to excel for further analysis
where noted*/
